## Overview
The project integrates three main components:
1. **Self-Service Portal with Predictive Analytics**: Uses historical data to predict the status of applications or requests, providing residents with insights into their application outcomes.
2. **Voice-Activated Services**: Enhances accessibility by allowing residents to interact with the system using voice commands to apply for permits, check statuses, and request services.
3. **Customizable Public Dashboards**: Provides residents with customizable dashboards to track various municipal services and their statuses, tailored to individual needs and preferences.

## Features
### Self-Service Portal with Predictive Analytics
- Utilizes a RandomForestClassifier to predict application statuses based on historical data.
- Offers an API endpoint for residents to check the predicted status of their applications.

### Voice-Activated Services
- Implements voice-based interactions using the `SpeechRecognition` library.
- Provides an API endpoint for residents to issue voice commands for various services.

### Customizable Public Dashboards
- Uses Flask and Chart.js to create dynamic and customizable public dashboards.
- Allows residents to visualize and track the status of municipal services.

## Installation
To install and run the project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Google Colab account
- Required Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `SpeechRecognition`, `flask`, `flask-ngrok`

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sid1018/self-service-portal.git
   cd self-service-portal
   ```

2. Open each notebook in Google Colab:
   - `Predictive_Analytics.ipynb`
   - `Voice_Activated_Services.ipynb`
   - `Public_Dashboards.ipynb`

3. Install the required libraries within each notebook:
   ```python
   !pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn SpeechRecognition flask flask-ngrok
   ```

4. Run each cell in the notebooks to execute the code.

## Usage
### Self-Service Portal with Predictive Analytics
1. Load the `Predictive_Analytics.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to train the predictive model and start the Flask API.
3. Use the `/predict_status` endpoint to predict the status of applications.

### Voice-Activated Services
1. Load the `Voice_Activated_Services.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to start the Flask API for voice-activated services.
3. Use the `/voice_command` endpoint to issue voice commands and receive responses.

### Customizable Public Dashboards
1. Load the `Public_Dashboards.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to start the Flask server and host the dashboard page.
3. Access the dashboard at the root URL to view and customize public service status visualizations.
